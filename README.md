# PyKPC - Python program for controlling Knauer Azura pistone pumps

This simple program controlls Knaurer Azura Pumps over serial port. There is an additional
possibility to get signal from injector with an arduino board.

Main goal for this project was to have a possibility to conduct experiments on a custom-made
equipment.

For now program is not internationalised and written in polish, howewer, I will
work on it.

## Prerequisits
* Python >= 2.7
* Arduino IDE + Arduino Uno/Nano or compatible
* wxPython
* pySerial
* PyUserInput (https://github.com/SavinaRoja/PyUserInput)

## Usage

### Menus

#### File Menu

* Connect pump - checks if the pump (and injector module) is connected and initialises
connection.
* Quit - closes the program.

#### Help Menu

* About - Short info.
* Manual - @TODO

### Main window

#### Flow

Input field lets an user to set current flow. For now, flow rate limits are hardcoded to
min of 100 µL/min and max of 5000 µL/min. By clicking the button, a proper command is send
to the pump. Flow rate can be changed at any time.

#### Timer

Timer field lets a user to set a time to automatically stop the flow. Click on a button starts
the timer. By clicking again user can stop the timer, without stopping the flow.

#### Options

* Start accusition manually – none action will be performed after injection nor end of time counting down.

* Start accusition when counting down ends – program will emulate a click, when counting down ends.

* Start accusition after injection – program will emulate a click, when samle is injected.

* Start counting down after injection – when samle is injected, program starts counting down and then stops the flow.

* Start flow when samle is loaded – starts flow, when injector is set to _load_ position.

#### Start/Stop flow

This button allows an user to manually start and stop flow.
